I want to build a secure API proxy service that allows me to grant controlled access to an LLM (like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT) for freelancers or remote workers. The goal is to let them use the model only for tasks related to my project, while preventing abuse (e.g., personal use, unrelated freelancing, or high-volume misuse).

Each user should receive a personal access token linked to specific tasks, usage limits, and allowed endpoints (like chat/completions). The system should:
    Authenticate and authorize requests.
    Enforce daily usage quotas per user.
    Require task identifiers for every GPT call.
    Log and analyze metadata (prompt, time, model, etc.).
    Detect misuse by monitoring prompt intent, usage patterns, and abrupt behavior changes.
    Automatically disable or flag access if suspicious behavior is detected (e.g., spike in unrelated prompts).
    Allow the admin (me) to review flagged users, re-enable access, or adjust limits.
The final system should be developer-friendly and scalable, with a basic web interface for monitoring usage and viewing logs per user or task.










üõ†Ô∏è Core Functionalities
1. Proxy Gateway for OpenAI API
    A backend service where users send requests instead of directly using the OpenAI API.
    This proxy attaches metadata, performs validations, forwards requests, and logs everything.

2. User Access Tokens
    Each user receives a unique API token (JWT or similar), bound to:
        Their identity
        Allowed task IDs
        Rate limits
        Usage quotas (daily/monthly token count)
        Expiry date

    Token must be sent with each request.

3. Lightweight Validation (Before Forwarding)
    ‚úÖ Validate token
    ‚úÖ Check quota & rate limit

4. Forward Request with Embedded Intent Classification
    We forward the user's prompt to GPT with additional instructions asking GPT to:
        Answer the original query
        Classify the intent of the prompt (e.g., code, test, doc, off_topic)

5. Real-Time Prompt Feedback
    GPT returns both the answer and the detected intent.
    We store this intent in the DB.

    We use this intent to track usage patterns over time and:
        Score suspicious behavior (e.g., frequent topic switching)
        Block or warn users if their "misuse score" exceeds a threshold

6. Deviation Score System
    Each user session has a behavior score:
        +0.1 for slight deviation
        +1 for major deviation (e.g., asking about cooking in a coding project)

    If total score crosses threshold (e.g., 2), we block the token or disable access temporarily.

7. Admin Dashboard
    View per-user usage logs
    See prompts + intent classifications
    Approve/ban/reactivate users
    Adjust quotas and tasks

8. User Dashboard (Basic)
    Users can see:
        Their usage today/this week
        Remaining quota
        Any warnings or blocked status
        Assigned tasks
