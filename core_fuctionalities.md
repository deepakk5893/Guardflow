I want to build a secure API proxy service that allows me to grant controlled access to an LLM (like OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT) for freelancers or remote workers. The goal is to let them use the model only for tasks related to my project, while preventing abuse (e.g., personal use, unrelated freelancing, or high-volume misuse).

Each user should receive a personal access token linked to specific tasks, usage limits, and allowed endpoints (like chat/completions). The system should:
    Authenticate and authorize requests.
    Enforce daily usage quotas per user.
    Require task identifiers for every GPT call.
    Log and analyze metadata (prompt, time, model, etc.).
    Detect misuse by monitoring prompt intent, usage patterns, and abrupt behavior changes.
    Automatically disable or flag access if suspicious behavior is detected (e.g., spike in unrelated prompts).
    Allow the admin (me) to review flagged users, re-enable access, or adjust limits.
The final system should be developer-friendly and scalable, with a basic web interface for monitoring usage and viewing logs per user or task.










üõ†Ô∏è Core Functionalities

## Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture ‚úÖ
**Complete data isolation between organizations**
- Each tenant has separate data namespace
- Subscription-based access with plan enforcement
- Role-based access control (super_admin, admin, user)
- Secure tenant validation on all API endpoints

## 1. Subscription & Plan Management ‚úÖ
**Three-tier SaaS pricing model:**
- **Basic Plan** ($29/month): Up to 5 users, 14-day free trial
- **Pro Plan** ($99/month): Up to 20 users, advanced features
- **Enterprise Plan** ($299/month): Up to 100 users, priority support

Features:
- Plan enforcement with user limits
- Usage tracking per tenant
- Subscription lifecycle management
- Trial period support

## 2. User Invitation System ‚úÖ
**Secure token-based team member onboarding**
- Admin users can invite team members via email
- Secure invitation tokens with 7-day expiration
- Beautiful HTML email templates ready for external providers
- Public invitation acceptance flow (no auth required)
- Automatic user account creation upon acceptance

API endpoints:
- `POST /api/v1/invitations` - Create invitation
- `GET /api/v1/invitations` - List tenant invitations
- `DELETE /api/v1/invitations/{id}` - Cancel invitation
- `POST /api/v1/invitations/{id}/resend` - Resend invitation
- `GET /api/v1/invitations/public/{token}/details` - Get invitation details
- `POST /api/v1/invitations/public/{token}/accept` - Accept invitation

## 3. Multi-LLM Provider Support ‚úÖ
**Flexible provider configuration per tenant**
- Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, and other providers
- Simple dropdown selection interface
- Secure API key storage per tenant
- Provider-specific model options

## 4. Proxy Gateway for LLM APIs
    A backend service where users send requests instead of directly using LLM APIs.
    This proxy attaches metadata, performs validations, forwards requests, and logs everything.
    Now includes tenant validation and multi-provider routing.

## 5. User Access Tokens ‚úÖ
    Each user receives a unique API token (JWT), bound to:
        Their identity and tenant context
        Role-based permissions
        Allowed task IDs
        Rate limits
        Usage quotas (daily/monthly token count)
        Expiry date

    Token must be sent with each request and includes tenant validation.

## 6. Lightweight Validation (Before Forwarding) ‚úÖ
    ‚úÖ Validate JWT token with tenant context
    ‚úÖ Check role-based permissions
    ‚úÖ Validate tenant subscription status
    ‚úÖ Check quota & rate limit per tenant
    ‚úÖ Verify user limits per subscription plan

## 7. Email Service System ‚úÖ
**Professional email templates ready for external integration**
- Beautiful HTML email templates for invitations and welcome messages
- Local email storage for development (saves to `/emails` directory)
- Ready for integration with SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES
- Template types:
  - User invitation emails
  - Welcome emails after account creation
  - Invitation reminder emails
- Responsive design with company branding

## 8. Forward Request with Embedded Intent Classification
    We forward the user's prompt to LLM with additional instructions asking the model to:
        Answer the original query
        Classify the intent of the prompt (e.g., code, test, doc, off_topic)
    Now includes tenant context and provider routing.

## 9. Real-Time Prompt Feedback
    LLM returns both the answer and the detected intent.
    We store this intent in the DB with tenant isolation.

    We use this intent to track usage patterns over time and:
        Score suspicious behavior (e.g., frequent topic switching)
        Block or warn users if their "misuse score" exceeds a threshold

## 10. Deviation Score System
    Each user session has a behavior score (tenant-scoped):
        +0.1 for slight deviation
        +1 for major deviation (e.g., asking about cooking in a coding project)

    If total score crosses threshold (e.g., 2), we block the token or disable access temporarily.

## 11. Multi-Tenant Admin Dashboard
    **Tenant administrators can:**
    - View per-user usage logs within their organization
    - See prompts + intent classifications for their tenant
    - Invite/manage team members with role-based access
    - Approve/ban/reactivate users within their tenant
    - Adjust quotas and tasks for their organization
    - Manage subscription and billing
    - Configure LLM providers

## 12. User Dashboard (Tenant-Scoped)
    Users can see within their organization:
        Their usage today/this week
        Remaining quota
        Any warnings or blocked status
        Assigned tasks from their tenant
        Team member information
