👨‍💼 1. Content Writers (Blog, SEO, Docs, Marketing)
🔧 Use Case:

Freelancers hired to write documentation, marketing copy, blogs, social posts, etc.
💡 Problem:

They may start using your API to write poems, homework, novels, etc.
✅ What You Can Do:

    Assign task_id = content_docs_project

    Use intent types like ["seo", "docs", "off_topic"]

    Deviation scoring tracks if they start using it for irrelevant things.

🕵️‍♀️ 2. Customer Support Teams / Prompt Engineers
🔧 Use Case:

You give access to your support team or L1 engineers to use GPT for customer replies, summarizing logs, writing macros, etc.
💡 Problem:

They start using it for personal tasks or off-topic exploration.
✅ What You Can Do:

    Task ID: support_autoresponse

    Intent types: ["summarize", "respond", "classify_ticket"]

    Enforce daily quotas (e.g., 100 messages/day)

🎓 3. Training or Educational Use (Academy / Bootcamp)
🔧 Use Case:

You run a bootcamp, and give students controlled GPT access for learning.
💡 Problem:

They start asking for answers to unrelated assignments, or use GPT to cheat.
✅ What You Can Do:

    Task ID: dsa_training, rails_course

    Intent types: ["code", "explanation", "debug"]

    Score and block if students ask: "Can you write my resume?" or "How to invest in crypto?"

📊 4. Internal Teams (Product, Ops, HR)
🔧 Use Case:

You give internal access for specific workflows like:

    Writing job descriptions (HR)

    Drafting feature specs (Product)

    Generating reports or summaries (Ops)

✅ You assign each department a token & task.

    HR: task_id=jd_writer → intents = ["hiring", "jd", "offer_email"]

    Product: task_id=spec_writer → ["docs", "acceptance_criteria"]

    Auto-block when they start asking GPT: “Write a recipe for butter chicken”

🛡️ 5. Reselling GPT access to clients (White-Label Use)

    This is huge if you want to productize this system later.

🔧 Use Case:

You give your clients AI access under your control for:

    Internal use

    Use by their freelancers

    Integrated in their tools

Each client gets:

    Their own token namespace

    Their own tasks & quotas

    Their own dashboards

You become a GPT usage management SaaS 🔥

🔜 Want to Future-Proof It?

We can later:

    Allow custom intent categories per task

    Add a "confidence" score per intent (from GPT)

    Let admins define "blocked topics" by regex or LLM rule

Would you like me to help you:

    Design the Task model schema to support multi-role use?

    Or expand the logging system to include user roles, departments, teams, etc.?
