## Current Sprint Goals
1. Set up Vite + React + TypeScript project
2. Configure Tailwind CSS
3. Create basic project structure
4. Implement authentication flow

## Next Sprint Priorities
1. Build common components
2. Create admin dashboard layout
3. Implement user management interface

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Build Tool**: Vite (fast, modern)
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (utility-first)
- **State Management**: React Query + Context API
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **Charts**: Recharts (React-native)
- **Tables**: TanStack Table
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation

## Component Library Strategy
- Custom components built with Tailwind
- Consistent design system
- Reusable patterns
- Accessibility-first approach

## Performance Considerations
- Code splitting by route
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- React Query for caching
- Optimized bundle size
- Image optimization

## Blockers & Risks
- None currently identified

## Notes
- Focus on user experience and intuitive design
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Consider accessibility from the start
