## Current Sprint Goals
1. Complete backend project structure
2. Implement database models
3. Set up basic FastAPI application
4. Create authentication system

## Next Sprint Priorities
1. Implement OpenAI proxy service
2. Add quota management
3. Create intent classification system

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Framework**: FastAPI (async, auto-docs, type hints)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (reliability, JSON support)
- **Caching**: Redis (performance, rate limiting)
- **Task Queue**: Celery (async processing)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **Testing**: pytest + httpx

## Blockers & Risks
- None currently identified

## Notes
- Focus on security from the start
- Keep API responses fast (use async processing for logging)
- Design for horizontal scaling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging and analytics
